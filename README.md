# Acquite Portfolio

**I shall put this simply:**
  - This repo is just the source code for my portfolio website
  - I have put it here so that any visitors can see how much effort i put into it

**These are some of the things it includes:**
  - HTML, CSS, and JS file trio all with.. *readable* commenting  
  - Asset images used in the website

The website contains complicated CSS and I am planning to add *much* more to it as time goes by, when I get motivation to do so.
